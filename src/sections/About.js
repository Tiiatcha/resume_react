        As an experienced technology professional with a strong background in
        SAP HANA and BW development, I am excited to pivot my career towards web
        development. My technical expertise encompasses JavaScript, Node.js,
        React, PHP, MySQL, MongoDB, and an ongoing commitment to mastering
        Svelt/SvelteKit and Docker. My track record includes significant
        achievements, such as creating an application that saved £1 million on a
        key contract with a cost of £8 million and developing a reporting suite
        that enhanced operational efficiency by 30%.
      </p>

        In my previous role, I introduced Agile methodologies such as Kanban and
        Scrum to my team, fostering a more efficient and collaborative working
        environment. This experience, combined with my skills in requirement
        gathering, stakeholder management, and effective communication,
        positions me uniquely for a mid-tier role in web development. My goal is
        to leverage these competencies to grow into a senior leadership
        position, ideally within a forward-thinking organization in the public
        utilities sector, a start-up, or a charity, where I can contribute to
        significant projects and help achieve organizational objectives.
